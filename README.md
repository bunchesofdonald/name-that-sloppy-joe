# Name That Sloppy Joe

A very simple sloppy joe namer, it has a list of adjectives (words.txt) all synonyms for sloppy, as well as a list of the 600 most common male and female names (names.txt). It will just randomly pull one from each, also will give only alliterative names.

The main reason I wrote this is that my wife and I were talking about making our own sloppy joe recipe, in which case, I think we need a special name for them.
A friend of mine mentioned on facebook that her son called Sloppy Joe's, Messy Bob's. It's clearly the better name.
